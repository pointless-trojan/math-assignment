# math-assignment
This is a simple program for math class which generates a sequence of output for the FizzBuzz game.
*Fizz = 3
*Buzz = 5
There are a couple of variants of the program, it currently runs as API but can be scaled as a micro service easily

#Getting Started
The APIs are testable through unit tests. You need to set up the project as a maven project and simply execute the tests

##Prerequisites
*jdk 8
*maven 3.3.x+
*access to latest maven repo or equivalent mirrors

##Deployment
can be pulled in as an API for now. Microservice extension possible with minor tweaks
