# math-assignment-server
Spring boot server application containing two API versions for populating Fizz Buzz

#Getting Started
*The APIs are testable through unit tests. You need to set up the project as a maven project and simply execute the tests.
*A swagger UI is also available under http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
*no security implemented for now, additional investment needs to be made to make it SSL and secure authorization for clients

##Deployment
*run server using spring-boot:start
*if port adjustment is needed create/adjust application.yml
